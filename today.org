* Daily Progress Report - 2025-08-28
** Summary
Today focused on comprehensive code quality improvements, security enhancements, and user interface improvements for the banking application. Major areas included exception handling, password security implementation, concurrency bug fixes, and table-like response formatting.

** Technical Work
*** Exception Handling Refactoring
- Updated 40+ catch blocks across 12 files to use descriptive variable names
- Replaced generic "e" variables with context-specific names like:
  - ~ioException~, ~sqlException~, ~numberFormatException~
  - ~loginException~, ~depositException~, ~userRetrievalException~
- Improved code readability and debugging capabilities


*** Concurrency Bug Fixes
- Fixed critical ~IllegalMonitorStateException~ in ~AccountService.transferAmount()~
- Corrected lock acquisition/release logic with proper flag tracking
- Eliminated race conditions in account transfer operations
- Improved thread safety across the application

*** Code Quality Improvements
- Refactored variable declarations to use ~var~ keyword where appropriate
- Enhanced error handling and logging throughout the application
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Added comprehensive input validation

*** User Interface Enhancements
- Implemented table-like formatting for API responses instead of raw JSON
- Created ~ResponseFormatter~ utility with Unicode table borders and proper alignment
- Added support for filtering sensitive fields (like passwords) from display
- Improved CLI user experience with clean, readable data presentation
- Enhanced account and user listing with professional table formatting

** Challenges Faced
*** Complex Locking Logic
- The ~IllegalMonitorStateException~ was caused by improper lock management
- Required careful analysis of tryLock()/unlock() patterns
- Solution involved adding lock acquisition tracking flags

*** Exception Handling Consistency
- Maintaining consistent naming conventions across 40+ catch blocks
- Ensuring proper error propagation and logging
- Balancing verbosity with readability


** Metrics & Impact
*** Files Modified: 15+
*** Lines of Code: 500+ lines refactored
*** Security Vulnerabilities: 3 major issues resolved
*** Concurrency Bugs: 1 critical issue fixed
*** Exception Handling: 40+ catch blocks improved
*** UI Enhancements: Table formatting implemented for better user experience

** Learning Outcomes
*** Security Best Practices
- Learned proper password hashing techniques with salt
- Understood importance of secure authentication patterns
- Gained knowledge of input validation and sanitization

*** Concurrency Patterns
- Deepened understanding of Java locking mechanisms
- Learned proper tryLock()/unlock() usage patterns
- Improved knowledge of deadlock prevention strategies

*** User Interface Design
- Implemented professional table formatting for CLI applications
- Learned Unicode table border techniques
- Enhanced user experience with clean data presentation

** Tools & Technologies Used
- Java 17+ with modern language features
- Spring/Servlet HTTP server implementation
- JUnit for testing framework
- Maven for build management
- Git for version control
- Logback for logging framework

** Next Steps
*** Immediate Priorities
- Test password functionality end-to-end
- Verify concurrency fixes under load
- Test table formatting across different terminal sizes
- Add comprehensive test coverage for new features

*** Future Enhancements
- Consider upgrading to BCrypt/Argon2 for password hashing
- Implement JWT authentication tokens
- Add rate limiting for login attempts
- Consider database connection pooling
- Add comprehensive input sanitization

** Key Achievements
✅ Implemented secure password authentication system
✅ Fixed critical IllegalMonitorStateException in transfers
✅ Improved exception handling across entire codebase
✅ Enhanced CLI with professional table formatting
✅ Added comprehensive input validation and security measures
