# Bank Project - Summary of Changes

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to the Bank project to remove authentication and simplify the code while maintaining the multithreading capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Authentication System
- Removed all JWT-related code and dependencies
- Simplified user login to use only username/email for identification
- Removed password fields from User entity and related DTOs
- Modified UserHandler to remove password verification
- Modified AccountHandler to use simplified user identification

### 2. Removed Timestamp Fields
- Removed `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields from User entity
- Removed `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields from Account entity
- Updated corresponding DTOs (UserResponse, AccountResponse) to remove these fields
- Removed timestamp-related code from UserService and AccountService

### 3. Updated Service Layer
- Modified UserService to remove password parameter from createUser method
- Modified AccountService to remove timestamp updates
- Updated method signatures to match the simplified data model

### 4. Updated DTOs
- Modified CreateUserRequest to remove password field
- Modified UserResponse to remove timestamp fields
- Modified AccountResponse to remove timestamp fields

### 5. Cleaned Up Dependencies
- Removed unused JWTUtil class
- Cleaned up imports in handler classes

## Multithreading Implementation
The project maintains its multithreading capabilities through:

1. **Thread Pool Executors**: Handlers use ExecutorService to process requests concurrently
2. **Atomic Operations**: Account operations use AtomicReference for thread-safe balance updates
3. **Lock-free Algorithms**: Deposit and withdrawal operations use compare-and-swap (CAS) operations

## Concurrent Operations
The banking system supports concurrent operations on accounts:
- Multiple deposits can be processed simultaneously
- Multiple withdrawals can be processed simultaneously
- Transfer operations are thread-safe
- Account balance updates use atomic operations to prevent race conditions

## Testing

### Concurrent Operations Support
The banking system is designed to handle concurrent operations safely through:
1. **Atomic References**: Account balances use AtomicReference for thread-safe updates
2. **CAS Operations**: Deposit and withdrawal operations use compare-and-swap algorithms
3. **Thread Pool Executors**: Request handling uses ExecutorService for concurrent processing

### Stress Testing Framework
A complete stress testing framework has been added in the `stress-test` directory with:
1. A multi-threaded stress test application that simulates high load
2. Configurable parameters for users, accounts, threads, and operations
3. Performance metrics collection (throughput, response times)
4. Profiling instructions for CPU and memory analysis
5. A convenient run script

To run the stress test:
```bash
cd stress-test
./run-stress-test.sh
```

## Build Status
The project compiles successfully after the changes:
```bash
mvn clean compile
```

To run the server:
```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.bank.HttpServer"
```

## Future Improvements
1. Add more sophisticated concurrent test cases with failure scenarios
2. Implement metrics collection for performance monitoring in production
3. Add database persistence for real-world deployment
4. Implement proper error handling and logging
5. Add comprehensive JUnit tests for concurrent operations

## Key Benefits of Changes
1. **Simplified Architecture**: Removed complex authentication system
2. **Easier Testing**: Simplified data model makes testing more straightforward
3. **Maintained Performance**: Multithreading capabilities are preserved
4. **Reduced Dependencies**: Removed unused JWT libraries
5. **Cleaner Code**: Removed unused fields and methods
6. **Comprehensive Testing Framework**: Added stress testing capabilities
