        <h1>Bank Project - Halftime Summary</h1>
        <p class="date">August 25, 2025</p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This report summarizes the successful transformation of the Bank project from a complex, authenticated system into a simplified multithreading toy project. The core focus was to improve error handling, streamline the user experience, and pivot development towards concurrency features.</p>

        <h2>Core Transformation</h2>
        <p>The project was significantly simplified by removing the entire token-based authentication system. This pivot allows the core focus to be on testing multithreading capabilities. Key changes included eliminating authorization headers, automatically generating account numbers to simplify account creation, and enhancing all server and client responses for better readability and debugging.</p>

        <h2>Key Achievements & Benefits</h2>
        <p>The recent changes have yielded significant improvements in usability, code quality, and maintainability:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simplified User Experience:</strong> Users no longer need to manage authentication tokens or manually provide account numbers, making the API easier to use.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Code Quality:</strong> A centralized <code>ResponseFormatter</code> class has reduced code duplication and improved maintainability according to the Single Responsibility Principle.</li>
            <li><strong>Better Debugging:</strong> Verbose error messages and consistently formatted JSON responses make troubleshooting significantly faster and more effective.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Testing Status</h2>
        <p><strong>All systems are nominal.</strong> Both server-side and client-side operations, including user management, account creation, and all financial transactions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers), have been tested and are working correctly with the new simplified architecture.</p>
        
        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>Future work will concentrate on performance optimization for high concurrency, implementing additional features such as transaction history, and expanding test coverage with comprehensive unit, integration, and stress tests.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The project has been successfully refocused on its primary goal of demonstrating multithreading. The architectural simplifications have resulted in a vastly improved user experience, a more maintainable codebase, and a solid foundation for future development and testing.</p>
