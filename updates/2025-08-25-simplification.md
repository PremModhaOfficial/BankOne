# Authentication Removal and Simplification - August 25, 2025

## Summary
Removed all authorization header requirements and simplified the authentication system to use JSON-only data for a toy project focused on multithreading rather than security.

## Key Changes

### 1. Removed Authorization Headers
- Eliminated all `Authorization: Bearer` header requirements
- Removed token-based authentication system
- Simplified all account operations to work with JSON data only

### 2. Updated Account Operations
- All account operations now rely solely on JSON data in request bodies
- Account ID is extracted from URL path parameters (e.g., `/accounts/1`)
- User ID is extracted from query parameters or request body JSON

### 3. Code Modifications

#### AccountHandler.java
- Removed `extractUserId` method that parsed authorization headers
- Updated all handler methods to remove userIdStr parameter
- Simplified account operations to work without user validation
- Updated error handling to focus on data validation rather than authorization

#### Method Changes:
- `handleCreateAccount(HttpExchange exchange)` - No longer requires auth headers
- `handleGetAccountById(HttpExchange exchange)` - Accesses accounts directly by ID
- `handleGetAccountsByUser(HttpExchange exchange)` - Gets accounts by userId query param or JSON
- `handleDeposit(HttpExchange exchange)` - Processes deposits without user validation
- `handleWithdraw(HttpExchange exchange)` - Processes withdrawals without user validation
- `handleTransfer(HttpExchange exchange)` - Processes transfers without user validation

### 4. Testing Results
All account operations now work correctly:
- ✅ User creation
- ✅ Account creation with JSON data
- ✅ Viewing accounts by user ID
- ✅ Viewing specific accounts by account ID
- ✅ Depositing money
- ✅ Withdrawing money
- ✅ Creating multiple accounts
- ✅ Transferring money between accounts

## Benefits
1. Simplified API - No need to manage authorization headers
2. Easier testing - All operations work with simple JSON requests
3. Focus on multithreading - Removed authentication complexity to focus on concurrency features
4. Backward compatibility - Existing JSON request formats still work

## Usage Examples

### Create Account
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/accounts \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{
    "userId": 1,
    "accountNumber": "ACC123456",
    "initialBalance": 1000,
    "type": "SAVINGS"
  }'
```

### View Accounts
```bash
# By query parameter
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/accounts?userId=1"

# By account ID
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/accounts/1"
```

### Deposit Money
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/accounts/1/deposit \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{
    "amount": 500
  }'
```

### Transfer Money
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/accounts/1/transfer \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{
    "toAccountId": 2,
    "amount": 200
  }'
```
