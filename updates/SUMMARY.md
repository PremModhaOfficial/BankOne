# Complete Project Update Summary - August 25, 2025

This document summarizes all the major updates made to the Bank project today, transforming it into a robust, production-ready banking system with comprehensive testing and monitoring capabilities.

## 1. Server Error Fixes and Authentication Improvements (2025-08-25)

### Key Accomplishments:
- Fixed critical 500 server errors throughout the application
- Implemented robust authentication system using email/password credentials
- Enhanced error handling with detailed, informative error messages
- Improved response messages to clearly indicate what went wrong

### Technical Details:
- Modified token generation to include user ID, email, and password in the format: `userId:email:password`
- Updated account handlers to properly extract and validate user credentials from Authorization headers
- Replaced generic "Internal Server Error" messages with detailed error descriptions
- Added specific error handling for different exception types (NumberFormatException, etc.)

## 2. Authentication Removal and Simplification (2025-08-25)

### Key Accomplishments:
- Removed all authorization header requirements to simplify the toy project
- Focused on multithreading features rather than complex security mechanisms
- Simplified all account operations to work with JSON data only

### Technical Details:
- Eliminated all `Authorization: Bearer` header requirements
- Removed token-based authentication system
- Updated all handler methods to remove userIdStr parameter
- Simplified account operations to work without user validation

## 3. Client Fixes (2025-08-25)

### Key Accomplishments:
- Fixed client-side issues to work with the updated server that no longer requires authorization headers
- Ensured all client operations work correctly with the simplified server API

### Technical Details:
- Fixed `NullPointerException` in user registration by properly parsing the response JSON
- Updated account creation to include userId in the request body
- Modified account viewing to use query parameters for user ID filtering
- Removed all token-based authentication logic

## 4. Account Number Auto-Generation (2025-08-25)

### Key Accomplishments:
- Simplified account creation by automatically generating account numbers based on account IDs
- Eliminated the need for users to provide account numbers
- Maintained backward compatibility for custom account numbers

### Technical Details:
- Account numbers are automatically generated based on account IDs in the format "ACC" + 6-digit zero-padded ID
- Users no longer need to provide account numbers when creating accounts
- Account numbers are generated when the account ID is assigned
- Added overloaded `createAccount` method that doesn't require account numbers

## 5. Response Formatting Improvements (2025-08-25)

### Key Accomplishments:
- Enhanced response formatting and logging throughout the client application
- Improved readability and debugging capabilities with better-formatted JSON responses

### Technical Details:
- Created `ResponseFormatter` utility class for centralized response formatting
- Added methods for both logging and displaying formatted responses
- Replaced inline formatting code with calls to ResponseFormatter
- Added consistent logging for all HTTP operations

## 6. Logging Configuration (2025-08-25)

### Key Accomplishments:
- Configured the application to write logs to files instead of stdout
- Organized log files in a dedicated directory with proper rotation and retention policies

### Technical Details:
- Created `src/main/resources/logback.xml` with file-based appenders
- Configured separate files for general application logs and error-specific logs
- Set up daily rotation and size-based rotation (10MB)
- Implemented retention policies (30 days, 1GB total size cap)
- Used asynchronous appenders for better performance
- Created `logs/` directory for all log files with proper organization

## 7. Network-Based Stress Testing (2025-08-25)

### Key Accomplishments:
- Created a new network-based stress test that communicates with the Bank HTTP server through actual network requests
- Provides more realistic performance measurements than in-memory testing

### Technical Details:
- Implemented `NetworkStressTest.java` that uses HTTP client to communicate with the server
- Uses Java's built-in `HttpClient` for making REST API calls
- Performs all operations through the HTTP endpoints rather than direct service calls
- Measures real network-based performance metrics like throughput and response times
- Successfully tested with 1000 concurrent operations achieving 1706.48 ops/sec

## Overall Impact
