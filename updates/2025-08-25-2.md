# Server Error Fixes and Authentication Improvements - August 25, 2025

## Summary
Fixed critical 500 server errors and implemented a robust authentication system using email/password credentials. Enhanced error handling throughout the application to provide more verbose and informative error messages.

## Key Changes

### 1. Authentication System Improvements
- Implemented email/password-based authentication
- Modified token generation to include user ID, email, and password in the format: `userId:email:password`
- Updated account handlers to properly extract and validate user credentials from Authorization headers
- Fixed the `extractUserId` method in `AccountHandler` to correctly parse authentication tokens

### 2. Error Handling Enhancements
- Replaced generic "Internal Server Error" messages with detailed error descriptions
- Added specific error handling for different exception types (NumberFormatException, etc.)
- Implemented comprehensive logging with stack traces for debugging
- Improved response messages to clearly indicate what went wrong

### 3. Code Modifications

#### AccountHandler.java
- Fixed authentication token extraction
- Enhanced error handling for all account operations (create, get, deposit, withdraw, transfer)
- Added detailed error messages for forbidden access, invalid IDs, and insufficient funds
- Improved logging throughout the handler

#### UserHandler.java
- Updated login handler to generate proper authentication tokens
- Enhanced error handling for user operations
- Added detailed error messages for user not found and invalid user ID cases

#### PingHandler.java
- Added proper error handling and response formatting
- Implemented logging for error tracking

#### Json.java
- Improved error messages in JSON processing utilities
- Fixed exception handling to provide more context

### 4. Testing
Created test scripts to verify:
- User creation and authentication workflow
- Account operations with proper authentication
- Error handling for invalid inputs and unauthorized access

## Results
- Server no longer returns generic 500 errors
- Authentication works with email/password combinations
- Error messages provide actionable information for debugging
- All account operations function correctly with proper authentication

# Authentication Removal and Simplification - August 25, 2025 (Later Update)

## Summary
Removed all authorization header requirements and simplified the authentication system to use JSON-only data for a toy project focused on multithreading rather than security.

## Key Changes

### 1. Removed Authorization Headers
- Eliminated all `Authorization: Bearer` header requirements
- Removed token-based authentication system
- Simplified all account operations to work with JSON data only

### 2. Updated Account Operations
- All account operations now rely solely on JSON data in request bodies
- Account ID is extracted from URL path parameters (e.g., `/accounts/1`)
- User ID is extracted from query parameters or request body JSON

### 3. Code Modifications

#### AccountHandler.java
- Removed `extractUserId` method that parsed authorization headers
- Updated all handler methods to remove userIdStr parameter
- Simplified account operations to work without user validation
- Updated error handling to focus on data validation rather than authorization

### 4. Testing Results
All account operations now work correctly without authorization headers:
- ✅ User creation
- ✅ Account creation with JSON data
- ✅ Viewing accounts by user ID
- ✅ Viewing specific accounts by account ID
- ✅ Depositing money
- ✅ Withdrawing money
- ✅ Creating multiple accounts
- ✅ Transferring money between accounts

## Benefits
1. Simplified API - No need to manage authorization headers
2. Easier testing - All operations work with simple JSON requests
3. Focus on multithreading - Removed authentication complexity to focus on concurrency features
