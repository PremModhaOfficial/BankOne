# Logging Configuration - August 25, 2025

## Summary
Configured the application to write logs to files instead of stdout, organizing log files in a dedicated directory with proper rotation and retention policies.

## Key Changes

### 1. Created Logback Configuration
- Added `src/main/resources/logback.xml` with file-based appenders
- Configured separate files for general application logs and error-specific logs
- Set up daily rotation and size-based rotation (10MB)
- Implemented retention policies (30 days, 1GB total size cap)
- Used asynchronous appenders for better performance

### 2. Organized Log Files
- Created `logs/` directory for all log files
- Set up `logs/application.log` for general application logs
- Set up `logs/error.log` for error-specific logs
- Configured rotated files with date and index patterns:
  - `logs/application.YYYY-MM-DD.#.log`
  - `logs/error.YYYY-MM-DD.#.log`

### 3. Updated Project Configuration
- Added `logs/` directory to `.gitignore` to prevent log files from being committed
- Modified run scripts to inform users about log file locations
- Updated documentation to reflect the new logging setup

### 4. Fixed Configuration Issues
- Corrected Logback configuration to use proper class names for Logback 1.5.13
- Fixed filename patterns to be compatible with the rolling policy
- Resolved ClassNotFoundException for non-existent classes

## Configuration Details

### Log File Structure
- **General logs**: `logs/application.log`
- **Error logs**: `logs/error.log`
- **Rotated logs**: `logs/application.YYYY-MM-DD.#.log` and `logs/error.YYYY-MM-DD.#.log`

### Log Settings
- **Rotation**: Daily or when file size reaches 10MB
- **Retention**: Maximum 30 days of history
- **Size Cap**: Total log size capped at 1GB
- **Pattern**: `%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n`
- **Levels**: Root logger at INFO, com.bank package at DEBUG

## Testing Results
Verified that logging works correctly:
- ✅ Log files are created in the `logs/` directory
- ✅ Application logs are written to `application.log`
- ✅ Error logs are written to `error.log`
- ✅ Log messages include timestamps, thread info, and log levels
- ✅ Rotation works when files reach size limits
- ✅ No logs are written to stdout/stderr

## Benefits
1. **Organized Logging**: All logs are written to files instead of cluttering the console
2. **Easy Debugging**: Separate files for different log levels make troubleshooting easier
3. **Space Management**: Rotation and retention policies prevent disk space issues
4. **Performance**: Asynchronous logging minimizes impact on application performance
5. **Maintainability**: Centralized configuration in `logback.xml`
6. **Environment Separation**: Console logging can be easily enabled for development

# Network-Based Stress Testing - August 25, 2025

## Summary
Created a new network-based stress test that communicates with the Bank HTTP server through actual network requests instead of directly accessing services, providing more realistic performance measurements.
